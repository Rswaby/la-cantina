# La-cantina
## Synopsis
New York City is the one the most popular cities in the entire world, millions of tourists
travel from all around the world to visit. One of the reasons New York City is so popular is
because many sitcoms over the years take place in NYC, such as Friends, How I Met Your
Mother, Sienfeld, King of Queens, the list goes on. These shows eventually make their
way around the world and when people watch them they hear many different
neighborhoods being mentioned every episode. When the time comes to visit they may be
eager to visit the neighborhoods they heard on TV.
Meetup and Eventbrite are great websites that provide a great service. However,
Eventbrite and Meetup aren't really meant for tourists. These websites help native New
Yorkers find fun events happening all over the city. Their traffic would increase if they
reorganzied their UI. I want to organize the city in such a way that allows anyone to
specify a neighborhood and then all the events in that neighborhood show up. If the user
is searching for a specific event then that event will pop up no matter what neighborhood
its in. In summary, what makes our application different from existing applications is that
ours will have a more sophisticated search engine which will appear simple to use to the
user.
## User Types
Our service will be focused on tourists in New York City. Most tourists know about the big
attractions like Times Square, Central Park, The Statue of Liberty and they're great, but
NYC is more than that. As a native New Yorkers we can present the city in a completely
different way so that tourists can get a better feel for the city. There are hidden gems all
around NYC that you can't find in the traditional tourist experience. Our app will give users
a more authentic experience of New York City like nothing else can.
User stories
1. As a local New Yorker, I can log into my account and set my preferences of favorite
neighborhoods, favorite event types. Therefore, whenever I log into my account I can
see recommended events based on my preferences.
2. As a big fan of 'Friends' I can search for Greenwich Village or Washington Square Arc
so I can visit places mentioned in the show.
